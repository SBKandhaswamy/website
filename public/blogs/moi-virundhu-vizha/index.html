                  <p>
                     Imagine a way where celebrations don't break the bank, all thanks to a special tradition passed down through generations.
                     In some peaceful villages of South India, people have their own special way of helping each other with money. 
                     It's a tradition called 'Moi Virundhu Vizha'. Think of it as a community-powered system where everyone chips in during a feast, and this helps each person when it's their turn. 
                     It's a smart and time-tested method that shows how people in these villages look out for one another financially. 
                     Let's explore how this unique tradition works!
                     </p>
               </div>

               <div class="col-12 col-lg-9">
                  <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">Old vs New</h3>
                  <p>
                     Back in the 1980s, when someone in a village had a big need for money, like for a wedding, they would invite everyone for a meal.
                     The people who came to eat would leave some money as a gift at the end. This money was for the person hosting, and they didn't have to pay it back.
                     Interestingly, the way 'Moi Virundhu Vizha' worked in the 1980s is actually shown in an old Tamil movie called 'Chinna Gounder'.
                     <img class="img-right img-thumbnail-mv" src="/img/chinna_gounder.jpg" alt="chinna_gounder"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Now, it's a bit different. Think of it more like a group saving plan that lasts about five years. People put in a small amount of money when someone they know hosts a 'Moi Virundhu Vizha'.
                     The host writes down who gave what. After about five years, it's their turn to host. The people they helped before, and maybe some new people, come to their feast and give money.
                     This time, the money they get helps them, and they will then give money when others host their 'Moi Virundhu Vizha'. It's become a cycle where everyone helps each other over a longer period.

                  <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">Invitations And Contributions</h3>
                  <p>
                     When someone is having their 'Moi Virundhu Vizha', they invite everyone they know. 
                     This means all their family members, their friends, the people they've given money to in the past, and even new people from around the village.
                     They usually get nice invitation cards printed. These cards have the host's name, where they live, and all the details about when and where the feast will be. 
                     The name on the card is also important because it helps the host remember who has contributed to their events before.
                     Sometimes, two or more people will have their 'Moi Virundhu Vizha' on the same day. If that happens, all their names will be on the invitation
                     To make sure everyone knows about the event, they also put up big signs, or banners, in the villages nearby. This is like a reminder in case anyone missed getting a personal invitation.
                     When a few people host together, they also share the money they spend to make the event happen.<br>
                     It's also interesting to know that sometimes, a single person might host a very big 'Moi Virundhu Vizha' all by themselves. 
                     They might spend a lot of money on the event because they hope to receive a large amount of money back in total from all the contributions.
                  </p>

               <div class="col-12 col-lg-9">
                  <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">Event core process</h3>
                  <p>
                     When people arrive at the 'Moi Virundhu Vizha', they will see different spots set up for each person who is hosting or participating in the money exchange. At each of these spots, you'll find a notebook and someone to write in it.
                     There will also be a person responsible for collecting the money, and usually a big pot ('anda satti') to put the money in safely during the event.
                     When an invited guest comes, they will look for the spot belonging to the person they want to give money to. There will usually be a small sign or name board to help them find the right place. 
                     Once they find the spot, they will tell their name. The person with the notebook will write down their name and the amount of money they are giving. The person in charge of the money will then collect it and put it in the pot.

                  <p>
                     When it comes to the food at the 'Moi Virundhu Vizha', there's usually something for everyone. They serve both non-vegetarian and vegetarian meals. 
                     For those who enjoy non-veg, you can expect rice, a flavorful mutton curry, a spicy mutton rasam (soup), and a unique side dish called 'botti' often cooked with blood.
                     Some hosts might also include fish, chicken, and eggs in their spread.
                     <img class="img-right img-thumbnail-mv" src="/img/feasting.jpg" alt="feasting"/>
                  </p>
                     <p>For vegetarians, there's usually rice, sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew), rasam, refreshing buttermilk, and a variety of other tasty side dishes.</p>
                     <p>The feasting starts pretty much when the event begins and goes on at the same time as people are giving their 'Moi'. 
                     There are usually people specifically dedicated to preparing and serving the food, making sure everyone gets a chance to eat.</p>
                     <p>What's really special is that everyone is welcome to join the feast â€“ family, friends, those who are contributing, and even people who just happen to be there. 
                     It's a very open and welcoming atmosphere, and no one will question someone they don't know who comes to eat.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">Managing the Returns</h3>
                  <p>
                     So, what do people do with all the money they receive? It really depends on how much they get.
                     Those who receive a large sum often use it for bigger things like investing in land for farming, starting a small business, or other kinds of investments.
                     People who receive a smaller or average amount might use it to pay off any debts they have. They will also usually save some of it to contribute to the 'Moi Virundhu Vizha' events of others in the current 5-year cycle.
                     It's often said that if someone uses this money wisely and responsibly, they can really benefit from this tradition. However, if they don't manage the money well, they might find it difficult to contribute back when it's their turn, which could cause problems within the community.

                  <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">From Feast to Finance</h3>
                  <p>
                     The 'Moi Virundhu Vizha' is more than just a cultural event; it's a practical and heartfelt approach to managing finances within a close-knit community. 
                     From the shared meal that brings people together to the structured exchange of 'Moi', this tradition showcases a powerful blend of feasting and finance. 
                     It offers a valuable reminder that sometimes, the most effective financial solutions are rooted in the simple yet profound principles of community support and reciprocity, often surpassing the impersonal nature of modern financial systems.
