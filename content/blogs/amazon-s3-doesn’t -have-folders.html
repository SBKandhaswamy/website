          <p>
            From past three years, I have been using Amazon S3, Backblaze B2 and
            Cloudflare R2 to store my files and data. I thought, everything is
            smoothly working based on my understanding. But one day, while
            listening AWS CLI, I realized: I didn’t really get it at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            This blog is about how my confusion with folders and objects turned
            into one of my most valuable lessons about object storage.

          <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">🌐 Object Storage at a Glance</h3>
          <p>
            Amazon, Backblaze and Cloudflare are providing the object storage
            services. Everything is an object. All objects are stored into the
            bucket. All objects are identified by their key. For example: Image
            is an object. Key will be object name <code>sb-logo.png</code> or
            <code>pictures/sb-logo.png</code>
            There is no folder concept. Just objects with keys that may look
            like folder path.

          <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">🔍 My Initial Confusion</h3>
          <p>
            I usually using tools like Filezilla, S3 Browser to manipulate my
            objects. They are one more level intelligent on how to display the
            objects in their UI. If my object is
            <code>pictures/sb-logo.png</code>, it will show the
            <code>sb-logo.png</code> object under the pictures directory. But
            internally it is only one object. I accepted this until I listed my
            objects by using AWS S3 CLI. That’s when my confusion started.

            🧪 The Experiment That Changed My Mind
          </h3>
          <p>The followings are my actual objects which I uploaded into S3:</p>
          <pre
            class="border border-start-0 border-end-0 rounded-end rounded-start p-2"
          >
            <code>
Kandhasamy/Images/website/author-logo.png
Kandhasamy/Images/website/logo.png
Kandhasamy/website/required.zip
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>But AWS S3 CLI listed the followings:</p>
          <pre
            class="border border-start-0 border-end-0 rounded-end rounded-start p-2"
          >
          <code>

Kandhasamy/Images//website/
Kandhasamy/Images/website/author-logo.png

Kandhasamy/website/required.zip
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            I shocked here why folders are listing as objects 😲. I decided to
            identify the issue and tried the followings:
          </p>
          <p>
            I created a folder called <code>foo</code> in Filezilla and uploaded
            an image <code>logo.png</code>. I listed the object through AWS S3
            CLI.
          </p>
          <pre
            class="border border-start-0 border-end-0 rounded-end rounded-start p-2"
          >
            <code>
foo/
foo/logo.png
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            When creating a folder in Filezilla, the client tool internally
            uploading this fake folder as an object.
          </p>
          <p>
            To confirm this, I uploaded the image file directly without creating
            a folder in Filezilla. Then I listed the objects
          </p>
          <pre
            class="border border-start-0 border-end-0 rounded-end rounded-start p-2"
          >
            <code>
Kandhasamy/Images/mine.png
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            CLI showed exactly that object. There is no fake folders. Then the
            following points are verified carefully:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style: disc">
            <li>S3 don’t care about folders.</li>
            <li>
              Some intelligent client tools are creating a folder as an invalid
              objects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Tool like MinIO is smart. To avoid this confusion, they don’t
                let us to create a folder without uploading a file.</strong
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">✅ Takeaway for Developers</h3>
          <p>
            If you are working on S3, B2 or R2, I would like to follow the
            followings:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style: disc">
            <li>Learn core concepts first</li>
            <li>
              Don’t rely only on client tool like Filezilla or S3 Browser - they
              are convenient but can cause misconceptions.
            </li>
            <li>Always verify using the AWS CLI or SDK’s</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            At the end of the day, everything is just an object with a key.
            That’s the beauty and simplicity of object storage.
          </p>
          <p>Happy Coding!! ☕.</p>
