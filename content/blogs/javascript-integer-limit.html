          <p>
            As a backend developer stepping into the world of JavaScript, I
            recently had a debugging experience that was both frustrating and
            enlightening. This blog is about how a simple data type mistake led
            to an undelivered SMS - and how I discovered one of JavaScript’s
            quirks in the process.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-9">
          <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">📦 The Setup</h3>
          <p>
            I was building a JavaScript program to send SMS notifications using
            a third-party SMS provider. Here’s how I structured it: 
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>
                    <strong>Configuration File:</strong> Included SMS provider credentials and the template ID used for sending messages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Template ID:</strong> Each message to be sent needs a pre-approved template ID registered with the SMS provider.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Functionality:</strong> Read the credentials and template ID from config, call the SMS API, and log the response.
                </li>
            </ul>
            All seemed fine. I completed the implementation, tested it, and the SMS was delivered successfully. ✅
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-9">
          <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">🕵️ The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            The next day, I decided to run a test again. This time:
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>The SMS was sent to the provider (request was successful).</li>
                <li>But the SMS was not delivered to the phone.</li>
            </ul>
            I checked the provider’s dashboard and logs. The response showed:
            <br />
            ❌ "Template not registered." But I had already registered the
            template. And it was working the previous day!
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-12 col-lg-9">
          <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">🧩 The Mystery</h3>
          <p>
            I double-checked everything:
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>
                    ✅ Template ID in configuration → Correct
                </li>
                <li>
                    ✅ Registered in provider’s dashboard → Correct
                </li>
                <li>
                    ✅ Code not changed since yesterday → Correct
                </li>
            </ul>
            So, what went wrong?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-9">
          <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">🔍 The Root Cause</h3>
          <p>
            I started debugging the actual request being sent. <br>
            Here’s what I found:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Yesterday's working value</strong> was:<br>
                    templateId: "1507100649629881791" // String
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Today's failing value</strong> was:<br>
                     templateId: 1507100649629881791 // Integer
                </li>
            </ul>
            The number looked the same, but here’s the catch: JavaScript has a limit for how big an integer can be accurately represented. 
            The value I was passing (1507100649629881791) exceeds the safe integer limit in JavaScript.<br>
            In JavaScript, the maximum safe integer is:<br>
            Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER // 9007199254740991
          </p>
          <p>
            If you go beyond that, JavaScript starts approximating, and the number gets silently altered. 
            So, when I passed the template ID as an integer, JavaScript changed the actual value - leading to an invalid ID being sent to the provider.
          </p>

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-9">
          <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">💡 The Lesson</h3>
          <p>
            This was a major “Aha!” moment for me.<br>
            Always treat large numeric IDs (like template IDs, phone numbers, etc.) as strings, not numbers.
            <strong>Why?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    JavaScript <strong>cannot safely handle</strong> integers beyond a certain size.
                </li>
                <li>
                    APIs often expect exact values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    String representation keeps the value intact and precise.
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-9">
          <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">✅ Final Fix</h3>
          <p>
            I updated the config to wrap the template ID in quotes, like this:<br>
            "templateId": "1507100649629881791" // String<br>
            Re-tested, and voilà! SMS delivered 🎉

          <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">🪄 Takeaway for New JavaScript Developers</h3>
          <p>
            If you're from a strongly typed language background like C# or Java (like I am), JavaScript’s handling of numbers can surprise you. 
            Here are some quick tips:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use typeof to verify the actual type at runtime.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Treat any large numeric ID (like UIDs, phone numbers, etc.) as <strong>strings</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Know the limits:<br>
                    Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER === 9007199254740991
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">👋 Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            This may seem like a small issue, but it reminded me of how <strong> data types matter </strong> - especially in loosely typed languages.
            I’m still early in my JavaScript journey, but this experience taught me to respect the quirks of the language.
