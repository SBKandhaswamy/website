              Unicommerce Service is a Windows service programme. This programme
              was created in.Net 6.0 and uses Sql Server. It will work with
              Unicommerce as well as another genuine system. Unicommerce will
              integrate with all online shopping platforms such as Amazon,
              Flipkart, Shopify, and so on. Unicommerce Service has several
              different work such as getting new orders, cancelling orders,
              creating invoices and manifests, and so on. These operations will
              run at regular intervals. I used a third-party library called
              hangfire to create this scheduler.

              This is a smartphone application. This application was created
              in.Net 6.0 using the Avalonia framework. It will compute the total
              wood cubic feet of furniture such as a bearo, cot, and so on. If
              we create furniture, we must calculate total cube feet utilising
              all wood sizes. The furniture pricing is calculated by the vendor
              using the wood cube feet as well.It will be handy for carpenters
              and vendors to compute the price of furinture wood based on cube
              feet and save time.
