          Hi, I'm Kandhasamy - a curious soul from Pudukkottai, Tamil Nadu. I'm
          passionate about technology, craftsmanship, and personal growth.
          Outside of work, I enjoy creating, mentoring, and exploring music,
          fitness, and carpentry.

        <h3 class="pt-3" id="side-heading">ðŸ™‹ About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m someone who believes in continuous learning - not just in tech,
          but in life. I completed my
          <strong>
            BCA at H.H. The Rajahâ€™s College, Pudukkottai (2018â€“2021)</strong
          >. Before that, I did my schooling at
          <strong>GHS School, Neduvasal</strong>, and
          <strong>Govt. High School, Pullanviduthy</strong>. After college, I
          taught myself how to build Windows applications using .NET and C#.
          That passion led me to my first role as a .NET Developer in 2022.
          Since then, I've enjoyed working on software that solves real
          problems. Beyond tech, I love to read, write, and build with my hands.
          I love doing <strong>carpentry</strong> work with my group - crafting
          chairs, cots, doors, windows and etc. I'm also a regular participant
          as a Moi Writer during
          <a

            style="color: #ac2bac; text-decoration: none"
            >Moi Virundhu Vizha</a
          >, a traditional celebration in my area. I'm also learning to maintain
          a healthy lifestyle. I regularly go to the
          <strong>gym to stay fit and active</strong>, and I care deeply about
          my physical and mental well-being. One day, I hope to
          <strong>learn singing and musical instruments</strong>. I also aspire
          to become a mentor for fresh graduates - helping them get started with
          real-world learning and confidence.
