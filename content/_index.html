                  Hello. I'm <strong>Kandhasamy</strong> and I'm a <strong>Dot Net Developer</strong>. I’ve been working in the field for about two years, and I’ve held several different positions.
                  I started my career as a <strong>Junior Dot Net Developer</strong> at a private company on <strong>03-01-2022</strong>. There I was responsible for creating apps that used C# and .NET to create windows and web applications.
                  I graduated from BCA in 2021. After finishing the degree, I self-taught myself how to create Windows applications using.Net and C# at home. In the middle of my self-learning, I looked for a job as a Dot Net developer. 
                  Then I got the job mentioned above. This is the procedure followed prior to being hired.
               </p>
                  <p>
                     I'm always interested in learning new things, not just technology. I'd like to learn to sing and play musical instruments.
                     Then, as a Mentor, I intend to assist graduated students.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     To refresh the technical mind, I will do the carpendering works with my group. In that I will make the bearo's, cots, chairs, window's not a OS ): doors, etc.,
                     And also, I will participate as a Moi Writer in <a href="blogs/moi-virundhu-vizha.html" style="color: #ac2bac; text-decoration: none; ">Moi Virundhu Vizha</a>
                  </p>
